It is the second course of the John Hopkin's Data Science Specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first impression was, 'Wow, a lot of people fail and retake the course' because at least three people posted that it was there second, third, or even fourth time 
that they were retaking the course. I don't actually know how many people fail the course because I have not seen the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say that of the posters who said they were retaking the course, none of them had previously learned a programming language. The course says that the only 
prerequisite is the first course in the series, the Data Scientist's Toolbox. If it were me, I think I would have at least said that previous knowledge of programming
language would be beneficial for at least two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason is that the instructor, in the videos, tends to give a high level overview of the idea he is presenting and then gives one example on the slides.
This style is not unreasonable and is actually quite common. For someone who had a grasp of the main computer science concepts in another language, it is really
more than enough information. In other classes that I have taken, the instructor will walk students through typing in each command and explaining the reasons for
the results. I found and still find this style very helpful in learning new programming skills. This teacher rarely does walks students through step by step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that the classes so far have emphasized the development of 'hacking' skills. That is the ability to research, often through googling, the answers
to whatever coding problem you are facing and to write artful questions to present the problem to others for their advice. I also think that this is a reasonable
approach for learning new coding skills; however, it is much easier for someone with some previous knowledge of coding than a rank beginner. For example, if I 
don't understand the syntax of a function or, worse, if I don't know that functions have a special syntax, it is very hard to ask a questions about an error that 
occurs related to the syntax of a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of lack of step by step instruction is mostly resolved by the interactive &lt;a href="http://swirlstats.com/"&gt;Swirl&lt;/a&gt; program. It is an interactive program in Rstudio.
It walks the student through each topic covered in class. It explains the topic, asks the student to type an illustrative function, and then discusses the result.
It was excellent. Swirl has a variety of topics in addition to R Programming such as data analysis, statistics, and regression. See the &lt;a href="https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses"&gt;swirl_courses&lt;/a&gt;
on github for more info. I'll probably take them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to some coding skills, a student will gain more from the class if they already understand statistics. The instructor explains the R concepts with 
statistics examples. If you don't know the difference between normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions, you will certainly be left scratching your head and 
just what heck the instructor just said. Also, R is for statistics. It is a domain specific language. If you don't understand the concept your coding, then it makes 
difficult to code it in R. Most of the help docs implicitly assume you know statistics in their explanations and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forums were vibrant and alive. I think it may have been the mutual suffering that brought people together. The community TAs were excellent. I am not sure I ever 
noted the teacher on the forums. With good TAs, the teacher is often not necessary on a MOOC, but it is always nice to get a thumbs up a post from the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, I did enjoy the class. In the end the all the programming assignments were fairly elementary, once one gets past the learning the new syntax and functions.
I left with a much greater confidence to learn a new language. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Coursera"></category><category term="R"></category></entry></feed>
