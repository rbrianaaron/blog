Summary: About Brian Aaron

I am taking some time off from paid employment to teach myself some new skills. This blog will record my journey. 
The blog is mostly for me and my learning to reflect on and process new ideas. If others find some of the articles helpful, that's great too.

My current interests include Python, R, data, statistics, and the markets.
